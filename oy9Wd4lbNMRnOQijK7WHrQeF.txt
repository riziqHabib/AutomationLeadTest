title:You Have Mail
text:A blonde went to her mail box several times way before it was time for the
 Mailman to make his rounds. 

A neighbor noticed her repeated trips to the curb and asked if she was waiting
 for a special delivery. 

"No," she replied, "My computer keeps telling me I have Mail."
